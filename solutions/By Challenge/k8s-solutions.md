    Most organizations are already using the cloud, whether it's a private, public, or hybrid cloud with varying degrees of success. However, they face a multitude of challenges when migrating their applications to the cloud. These challenges fall into one or more categories - _business, people, governance, operations, and technical_.

    A successful migration requires a comprehensive approach that takes all of the above challenges into account. It has to be aligned with your business goals and the deliverables tied to key business outcomes to justify your migration effort.

    We use our **Application Migration Framework**, a proven structured approach, to help your organization with migrating applications to the cloud.
