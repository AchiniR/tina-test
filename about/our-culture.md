### Our Culture

We are a diverse group of individuals from different walks of life with different cultural backgrounds, all working towards a common goal. For Randoli, diversity is not just about race & culture. It's about diversity of opinions, ideas and problem solving skills. We value critical thinking, debate and dialogue over hierarchical decision making.

The Open Source Way is the foundation upon which our culture is built. Transparency, collaboration, meritocracy & diversity are key principles central to our culture. We strive to practice these key beliefs every day at Randoli.
