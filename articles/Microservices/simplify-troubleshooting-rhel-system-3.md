Drift, a feature within Red Hat Insights, can help with managing and troubleshooting issues across a number of systems. Red Hat Insights is a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) configuration analysis service that is available as part of your RHEL subscription.

System administrators can use Drift to compare configurations, define baselines, and ultimately perform root-cause analysis of issues during troubleshooting. Since system configurations tend to vary and drift away from initial defined standard operating environments, it is important for users to be able to immediately check if a problem can be related to any differences from the recommended configuration.

In this post, we will explore some new features recently added to the Drift UI in response to customer feedback, including requests to help troubleshoot faster.

### Multi-fact Filtering

Multi-fact filtering gives you the power to create comparisons that drill down to the most important elements to you, negating the need to swap back and forth between multiple filters. It also proves to be useful for quickly comparing facts related to a specific issue while troubleshooting, and filtering out un-related facts.

Previously, filtering facts in a comparison was limited to a single fact name input (an example is shown in the first figure). As you entered a fact you wanted to filter by, the comparison table would filter out any fact name that didnâ€™t match the combination of characters you had typed, with each keystroke.

Substrings would also be matched (e.g., typing "kern" will give you "kernel" and "os_kernel_version"). And, if you wanted to filter a category name (e.g., installed_packages), just typing the full name of the category would bring it up by itself with all of its sub facts present underneath.
