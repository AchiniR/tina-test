- review: "Hey, I'm Achini Rathnayake. \n\nProgramming has been my passion since I
    was a teenager. But whenever I get some free time, I like to watch movies and
    do gardening. I like working in Randoli because it’s a great place to learn and
    develop our skills. People at Randoli are very helpful and never hesitate to offer
    their support."

    Hey, I'm Tharaki!

     I am into coding and learning new technologies. In my spare time, I practice dancing and watch supernatural tv-series/movies. What I admire about Randoli is that people at Randoli always help and encourage each other to grow. It is also the best place for a beginner to start their career in the IT industry.

- review: "Hi! I'm João Pimentel. \n\nI was lucky enough to get in touch with programming
    as a kid, and haven’t stopped since. I do like music and movies, but what I really
    like is spending time with my lovely daughter. What I like the most here at Randoli
    is the friendly and supportive people, which make me sure that together we can
    accomplish so much more than any of us could do alone."

    Hi, I'm Diogo Sousa.

    I am passionate about technology and believe it is what makes me what I’m today, on my free time I like to play video games, drink a good beer, spend some time with my family and also study about the whole “Software Development Life Cycle” such as new languages, management process, infrastructure technologies and leadership.

    I like to be a Randoli team member because I am always being challenged, it is a good place to learn new things, a very good team with a lot of respect and always being helpful. Here, who makes the limit is you, so, if you want to learn something, for sure you will be more than welcome in the Randoli Team.

    Hi, I'm Matheus Melo.

    I have a lot of different hobbies I’m passionate about, including making music, playing video games, and watching Formula 1 on a Sunday morning. I’ve always wanted to become a Software Engineer since I was a little kid, and I started doing my own projects at the age of 10. My favorite thing about working for Randoli is diversity, not only our team has a lot of different people, we always have the pleasure to work with all different things and new challenges.

- review: "My name is Glory Davies and here are some fun facts about myself.  I am
    a very quiet and reserved person that enjoy weekend nights at home with a glass
    of wine in front of the television \nwatching a good movie. In addition, I  also
    love cooking, especially for our family get-togethers. \nI’ve been at Randoli
    for over 2 years now working in Financial Operations. We have a good company culture
    and enjoy working here."
