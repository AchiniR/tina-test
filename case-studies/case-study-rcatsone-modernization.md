challenge_heading: Key Objectives
challenge_content: |-
  The engagement had the following key objectives

  * Cloud-Native to ensure the solution is cloud ready as part of the overall organization strategy.


  * Migrate from windows services to Microservices using Springboot


  * CI/CD pipelines for faster feedback & rapid delivery of business functionality.
solution_heading: Solution & Approach Cloud-Native & Test-Driven-Development
solution_content: "Randoli Inc provided thought leadership & software delivery services
  to help transform the existing services to Microservices based on Camel/Springboot
  with CI/CD pipelines powered by Jenkins & Ansible with distributed logging via Elasticsearch.
  \ \n  \n**Cloud-Native** was a key objective. The new Microservices were implemented
  with **_Camel/Springboo_t** to ensure the services are lightweight and can be easily
  containerized.\n\nThe services had a myriad of configuration options to allow easy
  customization which was easily implemented via Springboots rich configuration model.\n\nThe
  QoSExecutor service relies on complex orchestration of connectivity to various probes
  & data flows along with complex SQL queries & calculations to support it's real-time
  network-wide performance and availability information. We used **_Apache Camel's_**
  built in support for transports to handle the connectivity to various probes in
  parallel and the enterprise-integration-pattern components to manage the orchestration
  to ensure the information is retrieved and processed efficiently with minimal latency.\n\n**Test
  Driven Development** approach was followed to ensure faster feedback loop on various
  adjustments we had to make during the testing phase allowing the team to provide
  faster resolution time for defects.\n\n**CI/CD pipelines** using Jenkins with Ansible
  playbooks for rapid deployment into the customers UAT environment. This coupled
  with automated testing as described above, allowed the team to deploy code rapidly
  with a higher degree of confidence and was instrumental in delivering the solution
  on-time and on-budget."
