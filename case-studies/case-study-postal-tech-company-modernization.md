  The postal technology company is the Information Technology provider for the parent
  company that operates the largest retail network and the biggest transportation fleet
  in Canada to provide Canadians with postal and parcel delivery services.

  In order to handle the year over year growth in transaction volumes during the holiday shopping season, the company entrusted Red Hat & Randoli to provide thought leadership & software delivery services to help modernize its payment gateway using Red Hat® Integration & Red Hat® OpenShift Container Platform as part of the organization's digital transformation mandate.

challenge_content: |-
  The customer was looking to overcome the following challenges with the
  modernization engagement with Red Hat & Randoli.

  * Move away from the outdated monolithic platform to Microservices
  * Required better scalability to meet peak volumes during holiday season
  * Very high licensing cost of the existing Oracle SOA Suite platform
solution_heading: Solution - Agile Integration & Cloud-Native
solution_content: |-
  A key objective for the new solution is to handle the year over year growth in transaction volumes that was experienced during Black Friday and Christmas holiday shopping. To improve scalability & agility to meet the increasing demand, it was decided to adopt an **agile integration** strategy, where **decentralized & distributed integration, APIs and containers** are the key pillars.

  Another key objective was **cloud-native** where Microservices, Containers, Automation & DevOps are key pillars.

  To meet those key objectives, we leveraged Apache Camel/Springboot to implement the integration capabilities as Microservices with container-based infrastructure & automation provided via Red Hat® OpenShift Container Platform. We had to leave in place the existing SOAP based interfaces to support legacy applications. However a parallel REST interface was implemented for each Microservice to allow easy integration for new applications being developed or existing applications going through modernization.

  There were many challenges with having to reverse engineer the existing system, unclear requirements, tight deadlines and gaps with operational procedures to being the first major application to go to production on the customer’s Red Hat OpenShift platform. The Randoli team in collaboration with Red Hat worked diligently with the customer to overcome the challenges and deploy the solution to production.

  The randoli team got excellent support from the team that was championing the DevOps strategy at the customer. The teams worked together to improve the process and helped fix operational gaps. Additionally the Randoli team coached and mentored the customers development team to ensure they continue to follow the best practices as they take over the application to ensure long term success.

  Despite being the first critical path application for the customer to go live on their
  OpenShift application, we were able to work together to ensure the application was
  successfully deployed and operational with minimal disruptions to existing business
  operations.

  The following results were notable

  * 2x Throughput with less cpu & memory compared to existing solution.
  * Ability to scale easily to adjust to demand within seconds compared to weeks
    of lead time with the existing solution. This allowed the customer to handle
    orders-of-magnitude increase in volumes experienced during Black Friday and
    Christmas holidays seasons.
  * Cost savings on licensing & improved scalability with less resources
  * Developer efficiencies due to use of Camel, OpenShift with best practices and
    guidance from the Randoli + Red Hat team.
  * Camel’s rich library of prebuilt components for enterprise-integration-patterns,
    transports & data formats increased developer efficiency & accelerated
    development allowing quicker time to market.
  * Camels first class support for test driven development allowed the developers to
    handle changing business requirements & defects with confidence, improving
    faster resolution time.
  * The ability to externalize & centralize the business rules in a self documenting
    way.
  * Increased visibility into which business rules were executed and how those
    decisions were made.
  * Much improved operational metrics, dashboards and logging capabilities
