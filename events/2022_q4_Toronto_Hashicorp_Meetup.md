  When adopting Kubernetes, managing secrets is an important consideration that every organization grapples with. When seeking for solutions, most organizations prefer to manage secrets in a GitOps friendly manner.

  HashiCorp Vault provides a comprehensive secret management solution, while External Secrets Operator provides an elegant abstraction to several Secret Stores including HashiCorp Vault.

  External Secrets allows you to define your secrets declaratively via CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) while it syncs with the defined secret store to fetch your secrets securely.
