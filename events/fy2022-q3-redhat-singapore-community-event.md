**Abstract**

We helped our customers to migrate and modernize 250+ applications of varying sizes onto Kubernetes. These customers come from a wide variety of industries including manufacturing, logistics, financial service, and government agencies to name a few.

We continuously improved & evolved our approach based on the challenges, the failures and successes we experienced. This eventually inspired us to build a developer self-service platform with DevOps automation.

The session will discuss our learnings and provide you with suggestions for building an application platform on top of Kubernetes to help your teams to stay focused on delivering business value without having to grapple with the complexity of Kubernetes.
