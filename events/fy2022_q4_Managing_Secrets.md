Managing secrets is an essential consideration when you adopt Kubernetes.  
  
There are several approaches to storing and correctly using secrets while following a GitOps approach. These improve the coordination between your developers and platform / SRE teams without compromising security and while getting the full benefits of GitOps.  
  
Webinar participants will learn:  
\- Different options available when handling secrets in Kubernetes  
\- How we evaluated the options, the pros and cons of each and why we selected the External Secrets Operator  
\- How we implemented the External Secrets Operator with HashiCorp Vault and the lessons we learned in doing so  
  
After a 30 minutes talk, there will be 15 minutes for Q&A. Weâ€™d like to encourage you to submit your questions in advance.
