**Details**

Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service to run Kubernetes in the AWS cloud. If you are on EKS or planning to use EKS come join us to learn the best practices of containerizing applications and setting up CI/CD pipelines in in a cloud-native environment to get the best of your EKS experience.

As we delve into each section we'll show you how our platform engineering solution App Director simplify and accelerate each activity.

We'll dive into:

* The best practices of containerizing applications
* How to mitigate software supply chain security
* How to build a cloud native continuous integration (CI) pipeline
* Strategies for handling continuous deployment (CD) on Kubernetes
* How App Director can help accelerate these aspects with minimal Kubernetes knowledge

After a 40-minute talk, there will be 15 minutes for Q&A. Weâ€™d like to encourage you to submit your questions in advance.

The link to the webinar will be sent prior to the event.
