Craig Young, Solutions Architect, Innovapost

In this session, we’ll explore how Red Hat Consulting helped Innovapost migrate their payment gateway applications off Oracle SOA Suite to Camel/Springboot on Red Hat OpenShift.

Video is available on demand from the [RH Summit 2021 Website](https://events.summit.redhat.com/widget/redhat/sum21/sessioncatalog/session/1606778018116001DNu3)

The primary drivers for the migration were,

* Move to cloud-native technologies in keeping with the organizational digital transformation mandate.
* Move away from an outdated centralized platform to a decentralized architecture for efficiency, scalability, and manageability and very high licensing costs of the existing platform.

We’ll discuss,

* The high-level approach we took during the migration including architecture and design decisions.
* How we used Camel/Springboot to implement the services.
* Why and how we used Drools for implementing business rules.
* The test-driven approach using Camel testing framework and how it helped reduce issues.
* CI/CD and build process on Red Hat OpenShift.
* How we tackled logging, monitoring, and tracing challenges.
