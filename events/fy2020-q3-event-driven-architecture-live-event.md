Are you currently building Microservices? Do the following challenges sound familiar? Join us to see how an event-driven approach may help overcome these challenges.

- I have a large number of Microservices that need to communicate asynchronously.
- I need to communicate the same information to more than one service simultaneously.
- I want my applications to be available during partial failures.
- I want my Microservices to be decoupled, independent and highly scalable.
- The typical HTTPS approach often leads to tight point-to-point coupling, is there an alternative?

Event-driven Microservices backed by highly available messaging infrastructure helps you build robust, resilient & highly scalable applications. We take a deep dive into event-driven architectures & discuss several patterns that can be used when building Microservices & the challenges associated with implementing them. We then look at how to leverage Apache Camel, Springboot & Kafka on Openshift/Kubernetes to implement event-driven Microservices.
