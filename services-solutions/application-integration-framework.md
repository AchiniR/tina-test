# THE CASE FOR INTEGRATION

Integration should be the foundation of every modernization effort. It provides the underlying platform for your organization to deliver new business capabilities rapidly. Therefore every organization needs an enterprise integration strategy as a core discipline.

We can help you build that solid foundation using Enterprise Integration Patterns, Apache Camel, APIs, Messaging and cloud-native technologies.

# THE CHALLENGE

The typical organization have a mixture of legacy, COTS, in-house built applications and cloud based SaaS appliations from vendors/partners. These applications speaks different data formats over different protocols and tend to have their own data sources. These systems may already be connected via point-to-point integration or using enterprise-service-bus (ESB) technologies that may have challenges handling your volume & scale.
Connecting these disparate systems with each other for sharing of information or building new applications may pose the following challenges,

# THE APPLICATION INTEGRATION FRAMEWORK

#### Iterative, Measurable, Agile

Our framework consists of battle tested processes & tools plus cutting-edge cloud-native technologies to help you build successful integraiton solutions that meets your business outcomes.

### Application Integration Technology Foundation

<i class="fas fa-shapes"></i>
<h3>Enterprise Integration Patterns</h3>
<p>The seminal book Enterprise Integration Patterns by Gregor Hohpe & Bobby Wolfe provides a catalogue of patterns for describing/modeling complex integration flows. These patterns form the foundation of popular integration framework Apache Camel.</p>
<p>While integration has evolved from simple point-to-point into centralized ESBs (Enterprise Service Bus) to a more distributed architecture, these technology agnostic patterns have been providing invaluable guidance in building integration solutions.</p>

<div class="ui-feature-content-box">
<i class="fas fa-cog"></i>
<h3>API - Application Programming Interfaces</h3>
<p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide a level abstraction for you products and services enabling other products and services to communicate without knowing how your product or service is implemented.</p>
<p>A well defined and managed set of APIs allows your organization the ability to expose your business capabilities to be easily consumed and integrated by both internal and external customers allowing for rapid innovation.
Therefore a carefully crafted API strategy is one of the pillars of a successful enterprise integration initiative.</p>

<div class="ui-feature-content-box">
<i class="fas fa-history"></i>
<h3>Event Streams</h3>
<p>The modern enterprise is a series of events and the responses to those events. Distributed message streaming platforms such as Apache Kafka allows applications to publish and subscribe to events that notifies state changes in various applications.</p>
<p>This forms the basis of several patterns like <em>Event-Notification, Event-Carried State Transfer, Event-Sourcing</em> that can be used to build resellient integration solutions.</p>

</div>
<div class="col-md-6 pr-md-1">
<div class="ui-feature-content-box">
<i class="fas fa-envelope"></i>
<h3>Messaging</h3>
<p>Messaging allows services in a distributed applicaiton architecture to communicate with each other asynchronously in a loosely coupled manner. The queue allows requests to be accepted reliably and the ability to scale the processing of them.</p>
<p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis & Apache Kafka provides reliable and scalable messaging infrastructure to build event-driven Microservices that are resilient, reliable and highly scalable.</p>

<i class="fas fa-tools"></i>
<h3>Integration Libraries</h3>
<p>Integration libraries such as Apache Camel with support for enterprise integration patterns, enables you to build complex integration flows with ease.</p>
<p>It offers a rich set of connectors for databases, message-queues, streaming platforms, popular APIs and supports over 50 data formats for data transformation. It can significantly speed up development of integration solutions.</p>

<div class="col-md-6 pr-md-1">
<div class="ui-feature-content-box">
<i class="fas fa-cloud"></i>
<h3>Cloud-Native</h3>
<p>Cloud-Native applications are microservices, deployed in containers & dynamically orchestrated, connected through APIs or messaging and managed via continuous-integration and continuous-deployment workflows.</p>
<p>Building your integration solutions on cloud-native technology enables you to be more agile and leverage the elastity, scalability & benefits the cloud has to offer.</p>

### Application Integration Methodology

## Discovery & Planning

We conduct discovery workshops with key stakeholders acorss all functional areas to ensure we identify and understand the requirements to ensure the integration stategy is aligned with key business outcomes.
