# THE CHALLENGE

Most organizations are already using the cloud, whether it's private, public or hybrid cloud with varying degress of success.
However they face a multitude of challenges when migrating their applications to the cloud.
These challenges fall into one or more categories - _business, people, governance, operations and technical_.

A successful migration requires a comprehensive approach that takes all of the above challenges into account.
It has to be aligned with your business goals and the deliverables tied to key business outcomes to justify your migration effort.

We use our **Application Migration Framework**, a proven structured approach, to help your organization with migrating applications to the cloud.

# THE APPLICATION MIGRATION FRAMEWORK

#### Iterative, Measurable, Agile

## Discovery & Planning

We conduct discovery workshops with key stakeholders acorss all functional areas to understand the following.
It lays the foundation for building a comprehensive migration plan to ensure success.

    <h3>Every migration is also an opportunity for modernization.</h3>
    <p>While you can adopt a lift & shift strategy to do the bare minumum required to migrate to the cloud, you could benefit more by transforming your applications to become cloud-native.</p>
    <p>During our assessment we will point out how you could benefit from modernizing your applications and outline possible strategies. Depending on the scope & complexity, you could choose to implement all or some of the recomendations during the migration.</p>
