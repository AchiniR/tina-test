# THE CASE FOR MODERNIZATION

Migrating your applications to the cloud with a lift & shift strategy might be a good first step, but it's not enough to benefit from the advantages the cloud has to offer and be ready to tackle your current & future business goals. Whether it's offering new business capabilities via APIs or making data driven decisions with a 360-degree view of your enterprise data in near real time, you can no longer rely on legacy application silos that are slow to evolve with time and cost intensive modifications.

# THE CHALLENGE

Modernization efforts face sevaral challenges. We recognize _modernization_ is not just a technical challenge, it's multi dimensional - there's challenges with _business, people, governance & operations_ that needs to be factored into the equation.
It has to be aligned with your business goals and the deliverables tied to key business outcomes, to justify your modernization effort.

Does the following sound familiar?

* How do we build a busienss case for modernization?
* How can we modernize without disruption to our business?
* We want to containerize our applications.
* We want to migrate from monolithic applications to Microservices.
* We want to build CI/CD pipelines to increase velocity.
* How do we build a DevOps culture?

We can help you overcome those challenges with our structured approach and help you get there faster.

# THE APPLICATION MODERNIZATION FRAMEWORK

#### Iterative, Measurable, Agile

The technology foundation of our framework is - **Microservices, Containers, CI/CD and DevOps.**
The methodology is an extention of our [Application Migration Framework](/application-migration-framework) as the same concerns and challenges are intrinsic to both approaches. We look at _business, people, governance, applications, security and operations_ areas related to the modernization effort to ensure it's aligned with the business goals of the organization as well as a smooth transition with minimal business interruption.

## Discovery & Planning

We conduct discovery workshops with key stakeholders acorss all functional areas to understand the following.
It lays the foundation for building a comprehensive modernization plan to ensure success.

At the end of the assessment we provide a document outlining the following,

* Executive summary & recommendations.
* Review of business, people, governance & operational concerns.
* Detailed review on existing architecture and future state.
* Detailed discussion on recommendations including  architecture, technology and development approach.
* Risk assessment and mitigation.
* A comprehensive modernization plan that outlines actions, owners & stakeholders.

<h3>Integration should be at the heart of every modernization effort.</h3>
<p>A successful modernization should make it easy to consume your business capabilities via APIs and streamline the flow of information between your applications improving accuracy and timely access to information for your decision makers. It provides the underlying foundation for you to compete in the digital economy.</p>
